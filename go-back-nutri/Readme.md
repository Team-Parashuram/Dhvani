# Nutritional Scoring API

## Overview

This service provides an API to calculate the nutritional score of food or beverage items based on their nutrient values. It uses Nutri-Score logic to return a health grade (A to E) based on standard thresholds.

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)** – Core backend
- **Fiber** – Fast HTTP web framework
- **CORS Middleware** – Cross-origin support
- **Modular structure** – Clean separation of models, scoring logic, constants, utilities

## Usage

Run the app:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Deployment Notes

This service is intended to be packaged as a **plug-and-play reusable component**, for example:

* As a backend API microservice
* As part of a larger health/food analysis platform
* Published as a Go module or npm wrapper (for serverless triggers)

You can embed this scoring logic into any parent application as a portable scoring backend.
